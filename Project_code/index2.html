            <h1>Question Bank Management Sytem</h1>
            <p id="p2">A Question Bank Management System is a software application designed to facilitate the storage,
                organization, retrieval, and management of a large number of questions and related data, typically used
                in educational institutions, training centers, or online learning platforms. Here's a detailed
                description of such a system:</p>
            <h2>Question Repository:</h2>
            <p>The core component of the system is a centralized repository where questions are stored. Questions can be
                categorized by subject, topic, difficulty level, or any other relevant criteria.
                Each question is associated with metadata such as question type (multiple choice, true/false, essay,
                etc.), author, creation date, and tags for easy search and retrieval.</p>
            <h2>User Management:</h2>
            <p>User accounts are managed to control access to the system. Different roles may be assigned to users, such
                as administrators, teachers, and students, each with varying levels of permissions.
                Administrators have full control over the system, including user management, content management, and
                system configuration.
                Teachers can create, edit, and delete questions, as well as generate quizzes and exams using the
                available questions.
                Students may have limited access to view questions, attempt quizzes, and view their results.</p>
            <h2>Question Authoring Tools:</h2>
            <p>Teachers and content creators are provided with tools to easily author and input questions into the
                system.
                These tools may include a rich text editor for formatting text, options for adding images, equations, or
                multimedia content, and templates for different question types.</p>
            <h2>Question Organization and Search:</h2>
            <p>The system offers features to organize questions efficiently, such as folders, tags, or custom
                taxonomies.
                Users can search for questions using various filters such as keyword search, category, difficulty level,
                or question type.</p>
            <h2>Quiz and Exam Generation:</h2>
            <p>Teachers can create quizzes and exams by selecting questions from the repository.
                The system may offer functionalities to randomize question order, shuffle answer choices, and set time
                limits for exams.</p>
            <h2> Security and Access Control:</h2>
            <p>The system ensures data security and integrity by implementing user authentication, authorization, and
                encryption mechanisms.
                Access to sensitive data such as exam papers or student records is restricted based on user roles and
                permissions.</p>
            <h2>Customization and Scalability:</h2>
            <p>The system is customizable to meet the specific needs of different educational institutions or
                organizations.
                It is designed to handle a large volume of questions and users, with scalability options to accommodate
                growth.</p>
            <h2>User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX):</h2>
            <p>The user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, with easy navigation and responsive design to support
                access from different devices and screen sizes.
                Features such as drag-and-drop interfaces, keyboard shortcuts, and context-sensitive help enhance the
                user experience.</p>
